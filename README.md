# Network Like a Boss  ðŸ˜Ž iOS / MacOS /Â tvOS
There are lot of methods to solve network layer problem in iOS. People have different opinions on different methods again it all depends on the requirements and the amount of flexibility that you need in long run.Â  Let me introduce you to a simple enum based network layer solution that is also scalable for a complex project. I have used AlamoFire and ObjectMapper combination but this same solution can be modified to be used along with URL session and Codables.
